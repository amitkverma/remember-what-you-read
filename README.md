# Remember what you read
NOTE: This is not a tool for reading but a structure for how 
to retain your knowledge from what you have read

## Reason
Have you ever read a book passage that you're certain could one day be applicable to your life? But, between your busy life, the passage quickly fades from your memory causing you to draw a blank when you really need to reference it.

When I began reading seriously for personal growth, I experienced this problem constantly. I was flying through books, but I was unable to recall or use any of the information.
